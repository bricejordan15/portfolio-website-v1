# portfolio-website-v1

First portfolio website I developed myself from scratch, started in March and finished in April 2023. Pushed to Github in June 2023.

Website was initally designed using Figma, assets and images were designed using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator mainly.
Figma link to web design here: https://www.figma.com/file/b5OCA8A7vfuqzlPNbjEbGV/Brice-Jordan-Portfolio-Website-v1?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=XwczmxzwiuRBejg7-1

Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website has since been replaced by a new version, this version is currently deployed using Netlify as of June 27, 2023. You can find it here: https://bricejordanportfoliov1.netlify.app/
